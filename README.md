# Coding-Tests
Coding tests primarily written for interviews. 
  
While looking for a new job in software development and I have faced a fair number of coding challenges along the way. On rare occasions potential employers have asked for a GitHub account displaying samples of my work. This page has been setup for that purpose. 
  
This is a collection of many coding challenges. An effort has been made to clearly spell out what the code requirements are for any method or class. In some cases, there may have been a more detailed requirements documentation provided from the requesting potential employer. When necessary, I may have fully or partially plagiarized those requirements. Please forgive the indiscretion, this is part of why I have not made this GitHub page fully public. To be fair to the interviewing parties, I will never provide information matching employers with coding challenges.
