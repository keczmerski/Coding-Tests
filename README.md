# Coding-Tests
*Coding tests primarily written for interviews.*
  
While looking for a new job in software development and I have faced a fair number of coding challenges along the way. This GitHub page was set up to allow all potential employers to access all or most of the coding chalenges that I have completed. 
  
An effort has been made to clearly spell out what the code requirements are for any method or class. In some cases, there may have been a more detailed requirements documentation provided from the requesting potential employer. When necessary, I may have fully or partially plagiarized those requirements. Please forgive the indiscretion. To be as fair to the interviewing parties as possible, I will never provide information matching employers with coding challenges.
