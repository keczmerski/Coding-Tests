# Coding-Tests
Coding tests primarily written for interviews. 
  
While looking for a new job in software development and I have faced a fair number of coding challenges along the way. Potential employers have asked for a GitHub account displaying samples of my work. This page has been setup for just that purpose. 
  
This is a collection of many assignments. These assignments are never very large but some are larger than others. Some may be combined in a single project where others are separate projects. This depends in part on how the assignment was presented to me and what kind of submission was requested.  An effort has been made to clearly spell out what the code requirements are for any method or class simply by naming the methods and functions with care. In some cases, there may have been a more detailed requirements documentation provided from the requesting potential employer. In many cases, when necessary, I have fully plagiarized those here. Please forgive the indiscretion, this is part of why I have not made this GitHub page fully public. To be fair to the interviewing parties, I will never provide information matching employers with coding challenges. 
 
Technology stack: Most of this code is in C#, often as a console application or library. This is where I am the most experienced and the most comfortable. I have included one project in JavaScript.
