Problems:

  The following folders each contain a README.txt describing a problem. Please read the
  problem statements and solve each of them in the appropriate folder.

Solutions:

  As a full stack developer at 3-GIS, you will be working in both TypeScript/JavaScript and C#.  

  If you are comfortable using all of the aforementioned languages, you are welcome to write one 
  solution in JavaScript and the other in C#. Otherwise, use either JavaScript or C# for coding 
  all of your solutions.  

  If there are any special instructions necessary to build and run your solutions, such as
  command-line parameters or PIP dependencies, please list them at the top of the solution.
 
Submission:

  After completing the problems, make sure that all of your solutions run without issue and
  that the actual outputs match our expected outputs. Once you are ready to submit the solutions,
  zip this folder and email it back to us.
